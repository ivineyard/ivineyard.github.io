## Design Principles, Concepts, and Theories Used

1. User-Centered Design (UCD)

   * Focused on making the interface intuitive and accessible for users of all experience levels.
   * Included multiple input methods (sliders, buttons, keyboard shortcuts) to provide flexibility.

2. Affordance

   * Visual cues (buttons, sliders) clearly indicate their functions.
   * The use of labels and real-time feedback (like the speed indicator and progress bar) informs the user of the effects of their actions.

3. Feedback

   * Immediate visual feedback is provided when the user interacts with controls (e.g., changing speed instantly updates the animation, changing colors instantly updates the gradient).

4. Consistency

   * The UI maintains consistent styling and behavior across different controls and interactions.
   * Keyboard shortcuts match the function of buttons for consistent interaction methods.

5. Accessibility

   * Added keyboard shortcuts so users can interact without a mouse.
   * Dark/light mode improves visibility and accommodates users with varying visual preferences.

6. Control and Freedom

   * Users can experiment with multiple features like pause/play, reversing direction, changing speed and color without fear of making irreversible changes.
   * The reset button restores default settings for easy recovery.

## Application of Design Principles

* Sliders for speed and height --> allow fine-grained control and give users a clear visual representation of current settings.
* Buttons for pause/play, reverse, dark/light mode --> provide intuitive, easy-to-understand controls.
* Color picker --> lets users customize the rainbow gradient while maintaining animation, providing personalization and enhancing engagement.
* Progress bar --> shows animation progression, giving users a visual sense of timing.
* Keyboard shortcuts --> complement the interface, offering alternative input methods that enhance efficiency and accessibility.

## Rationale for Using These Principles

* User-Centered Design & Affordance --> By providing multiple control methods and clear visual indicators, users can interact with the animation without confusion.
* Feedback & Consistency --> Immediate visual updates reinforce the connection between actions and effects, reducing cognitive load.
* Accessibility --> Keyboard shortcuts and dark/light mode improve usability for users with different needs.
* Control and Freedom --> Features like pause/play, reverse, and reset empower users to explore the animation without frustration.

These design choices collectively enhance the **overall user experience**, making the webpage interactive, intuitive, and accessible, while allowing users to explore creative options with the animation.
