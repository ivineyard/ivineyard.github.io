-- Design Principles, Concepts, and Theories Used --
1. Visual Hierarchy
Large counter display draws the user’s attention first.
Buttons are secondary, clearly indicating available actions.
2. Affordance and Feedback
Buttons provide visual feedback when clicked (shadow, movement), following Norman’s principles of affordance.
Color changes in the counter value give immediate feedback about its state (positive, negative, zero).
3. Consistency and Simplicity
Uniform button styles, spacing, and colors improve predictability.
Minimalistic card design reduces distractions.
4. Accessibility
Light/Dark mode toggle supports user preference and improves readability in different lighting.
High contrast between text and background enhances usability.
5. Responsive Design
Grid-based centering ensures the layout works across multiple screen sizes.
Buttons and text scale appropriately to maintain usability.

-- Application of Design Principles --
**Visual Hierarchy**: Counter display dominates the interface to indicate primary functionality.
**Affordance & Feedback**: Buttons and counter color changes provide immediate visual feedback for interactions.
**Consistency**: Button style, placement, and colors are consistent for predictability.
**Accessibility**: Light/Dark mode and high-contrast elements make the app usable for all users.
**Simplicity**: Clean layout keeps focus on the main task—tracking the counter.
**Responsive Design**: Layout adapts seamlessly to different devices without breaking functionality.

-- Reasoning Behind Design Choices --
- **Large, readable counter display**: Ensures users can see the value at a glance.
- **Color feedback for positive/negative numbers**: Improves comprehension and reduces errors.
- **Interactive, visually responsive buttons**: Confirms user actions and improves usability.
- **Light/Dark mode**: Offers customization and comfort in various lighting environments.

- By applying these principles, the user experience is enhanced by making the counter intuitive, visually appealing, and accessible while remaining simple and functional.
